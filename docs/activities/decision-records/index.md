# Decision Records

## Why record decisions?

Most projects will make decisions that are agreed upon by team members and drastically impact the path taken to fulfil
the project's requirements. Recording these decisions is an important part of project governance and eases onboarding
for new developers. To make the most of decision records, those that relate to a specific codebase should be stored in
the codebase under `docs/decision-record/`.

## How to record decisions

Decisions can be recorded in [short-form](./examples/short.md) or [long-form](./examples/long.md), to provide the best 
results, long-form decision records should be used where possible. A good choice for the first decision record of a 
project is recording that you will in fact, [record decisions](./examples/0001-record-decisions-using-madr.md).
