# Diagramming

Visually communicating ideas and systems using diagrams is important because it promotes better understanding, 
information retention, collaboration, problem-solving, and decision-making. It harnesses the power of visual learning 
and facilitates effective communication in various fields and disciplines.

While this approach is important, you must not forget colleagues with visual impairments. **All diagrams must be 
accompanied by a description sufficient to understand the contents.** If allowed, generative AI tools like ChatGPT can
create a text description of any diagram by asking the following: "Create a text description of the following plantuml 
diagram: `<paste diagram code here>`", the resulting description can then be included under the diagram.
