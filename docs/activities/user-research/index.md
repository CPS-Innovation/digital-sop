# User Research

In CPS, we believe that our users should be at the centre of everything we do, and that everything we build, buy or commission should start with user needs. 

As we adhere to the Government Service Standard, user research plays a pivotal role in our commitment to delivering services that are truly user centred. To support this, we've established a User Research Insight Library—a repository containing all the valuable insights gained from user research activities across our organization. This library is a treasure trove of knowledge, offering in-depth understanding of user needs, behaviours, and preferences. To foster collaboration and ensure a standardized approach, it is mandatory for all teams to utilize this resource when sharing research insights. This practice not only facilitates knowledge sharing but also helps in building a cohesive, user-driven government service ecosystem.

To support teams in conducting user research to a high ethical standard and following best practices, we have created a user research playbook which describes how you can conduct your research in the best possible way. To ensure these ethical standards are met, user researchers are encouraged to read the playbook and work to it throughout your time with the Crown Prosecution Service. 

To further support teams delivering for our users, on this page we have created some high level persona’s to give you an understanding of our key user groups.
