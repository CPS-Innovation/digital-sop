### Demographics

| Age | Job role          | Digital Inclusion scale | Time in role                  | Childcare          |
|:----|:------------------|:------------------------|:------------------------------|:-------------------|
| 30  | Paralegal Officer | 9 Expert                | 4 years, previously in 5 Area | No / not mentioned |

### Traits

Case Material Awareness: **Moderate** | 
Tech Savviness: **High** | 
Police Engagement: **Low** | 
External Counsel Engagement: **High**

### Goals & Objectives

* To safeguard the message of any lawyer overseeing any of her cases and make sure justice is served 
* Strictly act on instructions, despite any format or delivery changes of the individual lawyer.
* Impressing superiors with foresight and diligence in cases (but with limited technical means) to earn right to have 
  more autonomy over my work (e.g. work nearer home)
* Be up to speed at all times on several cases at charge and pre-charge, wherever I am England and Wales.
* To prove myself and qualify for more single task based work
* To be able to protect myself and have a clear audit trail of case decisions

### Behaviours

#### Tasks

* Growing and scaling the case on the P Drive as the case evolves.
* Send links where things are saved to relevant team members
* Meeting court deadline for submissions and requests from defence
* Operate as efficiently away from base as home or office (e.g. at Courts/hotels)
* Prepare bundles by following instructions from lawyer, but also detailed step-by-step instructions with each technical 
  change (Egress).
* All things Court and Jury; printing papers, Victims and Witnesses.

#### Day in the Life

I am between two fast moving streams of materials; the input and output. I strictly act on instructions and represent 
CPS to my fullest capability in every external interaction I have. I have to fit around the needs of the current case, 
the workload for upcoming cases, and the patterns and work/life of the people handling the materials above and below me. 

I will work 2-3 hours away from home every day while a case is court. I am unable to work while I travel so have to keep 
myself in the loop when I’m in secure locations instead.

## Carl

Caseworker: The Librarian of CT Materials.

Procedural role in many cases.

> There is no way anyone looks at all this material - 60GB! But I’ll move it anyway, it’s all about the process.

|:----|:-----------|:------------------------|:-------------|:----------|
| 35  | Caseworker | 9 Expert                | 8 years      | Yes       |

### Traits

Case Material Awareness: **Low** | 
Tech Savviness: **Highest** | 
Police Engagement: **Highest** | 
External Counsel Engagement: **Low**

### Goals & Objectives

* To facilitate a paper orientated approach being digital.
* Reduce all technological friction in materials being received or served, e.g. tech issues, OSX issues, access to 
  HOLMES.
* To prioritise and be fair to all team members which need our services to bundle and deliver materials.
* Minimise all my cognitive load to be able to effectively deliver services across a high volumes of cases.
* Motivation: Autonomy (D H. Pink 'Drive' theory) To have the freedom to do the work in the way I want to around my 
  family commitments and timescales _"it may be tough now, but when there was paper? That was much so much worse"_

### Behaviours

#### Tasks

* Facilitating information and materials movement between many cases and many points in the case. Mainly large materials 
  and ‘bulk’ transfers, like from HOLMES terminal to P drive.
* Burning files to physical media, and organising the delivery
* Travelling to prisons to drop of laptops and materials.
* Highly technical but has support from IT specialist in the area
* Information management but NO knowledge of the case (not DV)

#### Day in the Life

I am the procedural glue that holds the case together. From the moment the materials arrive from the police, till the 
case is closed and I archive it all at the end. I ensure materials are where they need to be for the CT team. 

I run between our team, wider CPS, the police, prisons and prosecutors - everyone in involved in a case. I make this 
work fit around my family/personal life. I am able to process lots of files at once by ‘dragging and dropping’ files 
from one place to another. I have access to three standalone machines to facilitate this.

## Laura

Lawyer: The Buck stops here.

Major accountability for one or more cases.

> We don't do ourselves any favours. 
> If we could tell a story and show the evidence we have we could secure a guilty plea faster.

| Age | Job role                        | Digital Inclusion scale | Time in role                              | Childcare |

| 45  | Senior Crown Prosecution Lawyer | 9 Expert                | 10 years CT, previously 8 RASSO, and area | Yes       |

### Traits

Case Material Awareness: **Highest** | 
Tech Savviness: **Moderate** | 
Police Engagement: **Highest** | 
External Counsel Engagement: **Highest**

### Goals & Objectives

* Ultimately responsible for prosecution strategy on cases assigned to me, and the actions of the PO’s on those cases.
* Maintain a spotless audit trail from pre-charge to charged, to closed and archived. Decisions must be visible, at all 
  times.
* To present the best evidence to secure justice or protection of citizens.
* Seamless, traceless, accountable process.
* Don’t mind if a case is not successful, as long as it’s not on a technicality.
* Motivation: Purpose (D H. Pink 'Drive' theory) Poignant and powerful work _"not entirely selfless, I knew 
  Counter-terrorism would be more challenging, and it is."_

### Behaviours

#### Tasks

* Write instructions to POs in my preferred working style.
* Arrange case materials on P drive or other preferred way of working in Lawyer Working folder.
* I may be assigned to work with another lawyer as a ‘buddy’ or due to case work volumes. In which case my role becomes
  more collaborative.
* I have a narrow but creative focus due to the purpose of my work; to convince others and form a strategy.
* Fight defence and chase police.

#### Day in the Life

I will hear about a case summary from the police or a Senior before the materials arrive. Some horrible cases were 
involved at from the outset (11.7, Manchester Arena) but most there is build up of material from the police beforehand. 
There are findability problems with this.

Materials are not just information, they're a curated story detailing why we need to prosecute.

To compensate I organise my lawyer working folders to reduce any technical or process burdens from ‘Lawyer things’ and 
make sure at least I know what’s going on at all times.
