# Personas

Personas are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research in order to represent the different user 
types that might use your service, product, site, or brand in a similar way. Creating personas helps the designer to 
understand users' needs, experiences, behaviors and goals.

## Creating Personas

CPS has a collection of [Generic Personas](./generic-personas.md) to get you started. When creating new personas it is 
important to cover user needs discovered via research with actual and prospective users, not those explicitly defined by
business objectives.

### What to include

A persona should include the following sections and information.

* Heading
    * Name
    * Position & Role
    * Personal Quote
* Demographics
    * Age
    * Job Title
    * [Digital Inclusion Scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion)

    * Childcare Needs
* Traits - CPS Specific Suggestions
    * Case Material Awareness
    * Tech Savvy
    * Police Engagement
    * External Counsel Engagement
* Goals & Objectives - What the user aim to achieve generally.
* Behaviours
    * Tasks - Tasks that are a part of the user's role.
    * Day in the Life - What does our user generally do day to day?
