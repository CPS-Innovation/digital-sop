# Personas

Personas are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research in order to represent the different user 
types that might use your service, product, site, or brand in a similar way. Creating personas helps the designer to 
understand users' needs, experiences, behaviors and goals.

## Creating Personas

CPS has a collection of [Generic Personas](./generic-personas.md) to get you started. When creating new personas it is 
important to cover user needs discovered via research with actual and prospective users, not those explicitly defined by
business objectives.
