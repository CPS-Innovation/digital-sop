# Delivering Digital Services at The Crown Prosecution Service

The decisions we make when delivering digital services carry significant implications for the speed and efficacy of case 
prosecution, the allocation of taxpayer funds, and the security of data. Additionally, we must fulfill our broader 
responsibilities, including minimizing our carbon footprint, making transparent business choices, collaborating with 
responsible partners, and striving for societal advancement.
