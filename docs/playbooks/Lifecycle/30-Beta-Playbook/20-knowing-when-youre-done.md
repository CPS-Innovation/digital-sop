# Wrapping up

## Other things to consider at beta

You’ll usually need to talk about how you use technology, for example:

* the way you deploy software, proving you can deploy frequently without impacting users
* how you’ve made your service secure so users’ data is safe
* how you’ll work with cookies and similar technologies
* how you’re making source code open
* how you’re managing the limits placed on your service by the technology stack and development toolchain you’ve chosen
* how you’re using open standards and common platforms
* what the effect would be if your service was unavailable for any length of time and how you’re managing this
* how you’re testing your technology

You’ll probably also be asked about:

* your beta dashboard and the performance data you’ve published
* how you’re using styles, components and patterns in the GOV.UK Design System
* your future user research plans and budgets

If you’ve created any new design patterns - or learned anything useful about an existing design pattern - you should 
share what you’ve learned through the GOV.UK Design System.
