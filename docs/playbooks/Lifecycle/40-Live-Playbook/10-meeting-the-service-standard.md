# Meeting the Service Standard

Before the service moves into the live phase, you’ll need to show that you’ve used the beta phase to build a service 
that meets the needs you identified at discovery and alpha, testing and iterating based on what you learn.

## Solving a whole problem for users

Once you’re in live, you’ll need to continue to develop your service so it forms an intuitive part of the user’s wider 
journey.

This means continuing to work with teams responsible for related services, and continuing to address any constraints 
affecting how you can iterate the service.

During public beta, start putting a roadmap together for this work. Items in your roadmap should be ambitious, at the 
level of things like:

* continuing to make sure that transactions are scoped in a way that makes sense to users
* starting a service community (or joining an existing one) to support others working in your problem space
* continuing to address any constraints you identified at beta (for example, with legacy technology)

## Providing a joined up experience across channels

Before you move into live, you’ll need to make sure the people who support your users understand the online part of the 
service.

This might involve things like updating call centre scripts, providing training or finding a way for operations staff to 
walk through or familiarise themselves with the service.
