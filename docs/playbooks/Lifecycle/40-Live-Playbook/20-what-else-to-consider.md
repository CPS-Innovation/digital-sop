# What else to Consider

Before the service goes live, you’ll also need to make sure:

* you’re securing the service’s information
* you’ve got appropriate metrics in place to measure the success of the service, based on what you’ve learned during 
  beta
* the service meets accessibility requirements you’re able to maintain uptime and availability and monitor the status of 
  the service
* you’re able to continue with vulnerability and penetration testing
* you’re able to continue testing service performance
* you’re able to maintain quality assurance
* you have addressed, or have plans to address, any pain points that might lead to people being excluded

If you’ve created any new design patterns - or learned anything useful about an existing design pattern - you should 
share what you’ve learned through the GOV.UK Design System.

## When you need to retire your service

You need to retire your service if you find out users do not need it anymore - or that so few users need it that it’s 
not cost-effective to keep running it in its current form.
