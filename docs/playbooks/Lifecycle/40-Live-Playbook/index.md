# Live Playbook

!!! note "Work in Progress"

    This playbook is a direct copy of the [GDS agile guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery)
    and serves as a starting point for CPS specific implementations.

The live phase is about supporting the service in a sustainable way, and continuing to iterate and make improvements. 

You’ll also:

* continue to address any constraints you identified at beta.
* continue to develop the service and work with other organisations providing services that are part of the same 
  journey, so that you’re iterating towards solving a whole problem for users.
* transition or integrate any existing transactions that meet a similar need to yours - making sure that what you end up 
  with has a scope that makes sense to users.

You’ll have your live assessment at the end of the public beta phase. Spend public beta preparing for live.

You can download a poster that explains what the live phase is for.

## Running your service during live

You’ll need to work out how to run your service sustainably during live. This does not necessarily mean having an agile 
team on the service 100% of the time. Spend time during public beta working out what level of continuous improvement it 
makes sense to support, and who you’ll need on the team.

As in beta, improvements you make during live should be:

* based on user research
* tested to make sure they work with different browsers and devices
* tested for accessibility
* quality assured

You should also make sure you are clear on the effects that changes will have on offline channels, or any related 
services - and make sure none of your changes will have a negative impact.

You’ll also need to spend time during public beta reviewing the performance metrics you set to check the data you’re 
collecting will tell you whether your service is performing as it should.
