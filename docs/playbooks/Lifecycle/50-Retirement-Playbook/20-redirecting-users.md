# Make a plan to redirect traffic

Once the GOV.UK content team updates GOV.UK to say that your service has retired, the majority of users will be directed 
to the new service.

Some users will still try to access the service at the retired web address.

You should have a plan for redirecting those users to the new service, or telling them that the service that has 
permanently retired.

## Make sure your subdomain continues to work

After your service is retired, you must help users by:

* continuing to use SSL
* serving a redirect from your service to the GOV.UK start page

If your service has been live for less than 6 months, you must do this until a year after your service went live.

If your service has been live for longer than 6 months, you must do this for a year after the time it retired or until 
the current SSL certificate expires, whichever comes first.

Your GOV.UK start page will be changed to explain that the service is no longer running, and the start button will be 
removed.
