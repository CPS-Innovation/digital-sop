# Protecting information

You should have a plan for securing the information you’ve got about your users.

You should already have policies in place to manage that data responsibly, including details of how long it’ll be 
retained.

You must make sure that there’s support in place to maintain these policies and protect information.

If you’re giving data to a new service owner, you must:

* do so in line with your organisation’s data protection policies
* tell your users
