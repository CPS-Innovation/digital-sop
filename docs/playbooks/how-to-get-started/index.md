# How to get started as a developer/development team

## What are the CPS Development Principles

We follow the Central Digital and Data Office [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#be-open-and-use-open-source)

## What environment do I use for development, and how do I get one?

All development work at CPS must be performed on CPS-provided laptops. To install the required tools on your laptop, you will need local admin access.

To request admin access:

Raise a ticket through [Request Admin access](https://cpsprod1.service-now.com/esc?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=47594fa61b861510729e42a7b04bcbb1).

In the business justification field, specify that you require local admin access for development purposes. 

Provide details about your project, etc.

Please note that your admin account (e.g., username@CPSGOVUK.onmicrosoft.com) will grant you the permissions necessary to install software.

## What development tools can I use?

These are listed in the [standards section](../../standards/archtecture/Accepted-Software/code-development.md)
Required Software Tools

A software audit is performed on the machines to help remind people when they forget to use the approved set of tools

## What code repositories do I use, and how do I get access?

As per the [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#be-open-and-use-open-source) we will "Publish ... code and use open source to improve transparency, flexibility and accountability". 
The specific products are listed in the [standards section](../../standards/archtecture/Accepted-Software/code-development.md). Currently this includes GitHub and GitLab.

### Access to a GitHub repo: 

If you do not have a GitHub account, sign up for [a free account](https://github.com/signup) using your CPS email address.

If you already have a GitHub account, be sure to [add your CPS email address to it](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account).

Share your GitHub username with our GitHub admin who will grant you access to the relevant CPS repositories.

Ask the modern workplace team to add you to the Azure AD group to allow authentication to the repo

### Access to a GitLab repo:

Soon CPS will be providing Gitlab licences, in the meantime:

If you do not have a GitLab account, sign up for a [free GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up).

If you do have a GitLab account, be sure to add your CPS emailed address to it

Share your GitLab username with our GitLab admin who will grant you access to the relevant CPS repositories.


## What are the current repos?

Coming soon a link to the repos for Polaris, LowCode, Witex and Email Automation


## How do I get privileged access permissions today, and in the future

Actually the model is different but fine, we will ask Modern Workplace and SIAD to explain why. However, today it can feel a little  piece-meal and cumulative. We want to move to a model with standard role profiles and short-term elevations.



## What product provides Identity Management

Azure AD

## How do I manage infrastructure resources e.g. create, update and delete

Today we are operating as multi-disciplinary teams with Cloud Platform Engineers embedded within the development teams.

In the future we could move to a model where there are self-service templates for infrastructure and platform services commonly available to all application development teams
