# Playbooks

The Playbooks are a guide designed to help delivery teams create CPS' digital services more effectively and efficiently. 
This is a summary of what they cover.

## How to apply the GDS lifecycle

Broadly, an agile project will go through several phases. Each phase has a differing end goal involving several
iterations and will generally have a start and end date. These playbooks will guide you on how the GDS lifecycle is 
implemented at CPS.
