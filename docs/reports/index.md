# Reports

The CPS are now assessing a service’s alpha, beta and live service against the government’s service standard. The assessment team is currently made up of Technical Design Authority members to include: a Lead Assessor, a Technical Assessor, a User Assessor, and a Delivery Assessor. 

The aim of the assessment is to understand the progress to date, outcomes, and any constraints or dependencies that may impact the next phase of the project. Assessors RAG rate the information presented by the service team against the fourteen criteria of the service standard. The service can move into the next phase if it receives ‘amber’ or ‘green’ ratings, although ‘red’ areas must be reassessed against the standard at a future date. Any ‘amber’ areas must be addressed within the next three months after the assessment. Assessments usually run for between two and three hours, depending on the size and scale of the service being provided. 

Feedback reports are completed by the assessors after the assessment has concluded and are circulated via the GitHub platform for staff to view.
