# Creating an Accessibility Statement

After completing an [accessibility assessment](../../../activities/accessibility/index.md) you must create an 
accessibility statement for your service. If the service is a website, the statement must be available and linked to 
from every page, ideally from the page footer.

Engage with the CPS Accessibility Team to understand your legal obligations in creating an accessibility statement.
