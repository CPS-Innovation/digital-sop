## General Statement

This website is run by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this
site. For example, this means you should be able to:

* Change colours, contrast levels, and fonts.
* Zoom to 300% without content spilling off the screen.
* Navigate entirely with a keyboard.
* Navigate entirely with speech recognition software e.g. Nuance Dragon.
* Listen to all pages using a screen reader e.g. JAWS.
* Skip to the main content when using a screen reader.

We've also made an effort to ensure the content is as easy to understand as possible. However, a large portion of our
text covers complex technical information, the target audience of which are software developers, architects and others
working in technical disciplines.

For help making your device easier to use, see [My Computer, My Way](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) for advice and
guidance.

## How Accessible is this Website?

Despite our best efforts to ensure the accessibility of this website, there are a few known limitations.

* Activating the [search](#search) functionality with some speech recognition software is unintuitive.
* Some [diagrams](#diagrams) visually convey information about relationships.
* Some [slideshows](#slide-shows) may contain non-accessible content.

We’ll consider your request and get back to you within 14 working days, if you supply an email address.

## Reporting a Problem

or think we are not meeting accessibility requirements, you can use

### Enforcement Procedure

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and 
Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018. If you're not happy with how we respond to your complaint,
contact the [Equality Advisory and Support Service](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/) (EASS).

## Technical Information

The Crown Prosecution Service is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector 
Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

### Compliance Status

This product is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard.

## Partially Accessible Content

The content listed below is partially accessible.

### Navigation

On most pages of the website there are two scrollbars, the main scrollbar and the navigation scrollbar to the left of
each page's main content. Some speech recognition software, for example Nuance Dragon, struggles to choose
the correct bar to scroll.

* To scroll the main page say "scroll (up or down)".
* To scroll the navigation section use your speech recognition tool to click the mouse just above the first item in the
  side navigation bar, you can then use commands like "scroll down" to explore the navigation items.

### Search

On all pages of the website the search function can be accessed via normal means, if this does not work for your
specific software try saying "click query", or "show links" and "choose (number associated with search input)" which 
both work with Nuance Dragon.

### Diagrams

On some pages of the website diagrams are used to visually communicate entities and their relationships. While the 
diagrams can be partially read by a screen reader, key contextual information is missing when they are. For this reason,
all diagrams are accompanied by a text description that describes the diagram's components, their relationship and any
additional visual information. Each diagram is preceded by a "skip to description" link.

### Slide Shows

On some pages of the website slideshows are used to present information. These slideshows are exported from Microsoft 
PowerPoint and best efforts are made to ensure the information is accessible, however items like diagrams may not be.
Where a PowerPoint slideshow is present, a link to download the original presentation will show under the slideshow.

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility

We will audit the site to cover accessibility issues following any major changes to the functionality of the site. We 
will then audit the site once a year to identify and address any accessibility issues.

Please consider that this website is a prototype and work in progress, as such the content and features may be subject 
to change at a rapid pace. We have guidelines in place to ensure content is as accessible as possible within the 
limitations already discussed.

## Preparation of this accessibility statement

This statement was originally published on Monday 31 July 2023. Subsequent reviews are shown 
[at the top of this document](#accessibility-statement).

This website was tested in July 2023. The test was carried out by the CPS Accessibility Team and Made Tech Plc.

Made Tech ran a set automated accessibility scanners (WAVE, SiteImprove) across all pages of the site to detect 
compliance with WCAG 2.1 (AA). This was followed by a manual accessibility audit of a 
[representative sample page](../../../activities/documentation/kitchen-sink.md) conducted by the CPS Accessibility Team.
These checks were followed by manual testing with screen readers (JAWS, VoiceOver and ORCA) and speech recognition 
software (Nuance Dragon).

The audit found some flaws within the website, which were subsequently resolved or 
[documented](#partially-accessible-content).
