# Accepted Software

The inclusion of a tool or environment does not mean that it must be used but only tools included may be used.

Key to prefixes and version numbers:

* "Standard" items are standard technologies which are approved for current use.

* "Experimental" are being considered for standardisation by the CPS and are approved for deployment in non-production 
   environments, or on a case-by-case basis may be approved the Technical Design Authority for limited  production use.

* "Deprecated" means that although the item is available and permitted, in existing systems, it is not permitted for
   new systems and significant issues are recognised such that the CPS is working to eliminate them from all its
   systems, although this may take some time. New instances of deprecated items may be installed to support an
   existing system that already uses that item.

* "Prohibited" means no new instances are permitted in CPS services at all, whether provided directly or indirectly.
   Any existing implementations of these products must be decommissioned without delay.

* Where a version number is indicated that is the minimum version number that may be installed.
