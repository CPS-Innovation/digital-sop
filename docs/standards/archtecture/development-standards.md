# Software Development Standards

Example content to illustrate some development standards, this section is under development.

## SOLID Principles

### The Single-responsibility principle

There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.

### The Open-closed principle

Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### The Liskov substitution principle

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

### The Interface segregation principle

Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

### The Dependency inversion principle

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
