# Architecture Principles & Guardrails

This document describes current and former development tools, environments and standards which are agreed by the
Technical Design Authority as suitable for CPS use in connection with information processing systems where the CPS is in
a position to direct the development and implementation of those systems.

These guardrails apply to the greatest extent possible. For example, in the case of Software as a Service services many
guardrails will not be applicable, but those on interfaces and the desktop environment, amongst others, will continue to
apply.

## Architectural Principles

Details specific tools, technologies and standards in support of the CPS Architecture Principles which 
apply to all information systems.

## Status

Compliance with the Guardrails is now required. However, requests for variations will be considered by TDA weekly, and
it is expected that some current products may be in use which have not been recognised to date. There is no intention
to require the immediate withdrawal of current products or services.

Email [architecture@cps.gov.uk](mailto:architecture@cps.gov.uk) with requests for changes or inclusion of existing 
products and services, please put "Guardrails" in the subject line.
